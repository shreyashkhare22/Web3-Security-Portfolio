# 🛡️ Web3 Security Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Shreyash Khare**  

Specialized in:
- Smart Contract Security

## 🔍 How I Think

I don't scan for bugs.
I model attack paths.

Every protocol is:
- A capital flow system
- A trust boundary graph
- A game theory problem
- A state machine under stress

My reviews focus on:
- Capital drain vectors
- Accounting desync
- Precision loss & rounding exploitation
- Signature replay & EIP-712 edge cases
- Privilege escalation paths
- Economic design failures
